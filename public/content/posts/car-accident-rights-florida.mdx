## What to Do Immediately After a Car Accident

If you've been involved in a car accident in Florida, knowing your rights and the proper steps to take can make a significant difference in your case outcome. Here's what you need to know.

### 1. Ensure Safety First

The first priority after any accident is safety. Check yourself and others for injuries, and call 911 if anyone needs medical attention. Move to a safe location if possible, but don't leave the scene.

### 2. Document Everything

Take photos of:
- Vehicle damage from multiple angles
- The accident scene
- Road conditions and traffic signs
- Visible injuries
- License plates and insurance information

### 3. Exchange Information

Get the following from all parties involved:
- Names and contact information
- Insurance information
- Driver's license numbers
- Vehicle registration details

### Understanding Florida's No-Fault Insurance

Florida is a no-fault insurance state, which means your own insurance company pays for your medical bills and lost wages regardless of who caused the accident, up to your policy limits. This is known as Personal Injury Protection (PIP) coverage.

However, you can step outside the no-fault system and file a lawsuit against the at-fault driver if:
- Your injuries meet Florida's "serious injury" threshold
- Your medical expenses exceed your PIP coverage

### When to Contact an Attorney

Consider contacting a personal injury attorney if:
- You've suffered serious injuries
- There's a dispute about fault
- The insurance company denies your claim
- Your medical bills exceed your PIP coverage
- You're being offered a settlement that seems too low
