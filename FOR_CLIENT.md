## 🚀 How to Access Your CMS

### Your Tina Cloud Dashboard
**URL**: https://app.tina.io/projects/f262313b-8c9d-4f93-a387-b87565a285dd/overview

This is where you:
- Generate your authentication token (needed for admin access)
- Manage users who can edit content
- View project settings

### Your Website Admin Panel
**Local** (development): http://localhost:3000/admin  
**Live** (after deployment): https://thecostellolawgroup.com/admin

This is where you'll edit content!

---

## 🔑 IMPORTANT: Get Your Token (1-Time Setup)

Before you can access the admin, you need to get an authentication token:

### Step-by-Step:

1. **Go to your Tina Cloud dashboard**:
   https://app.tina.io/projects/f262313b-8c9d-4f93-a387-b87565a285dd/overview

2. **Click "Tokens"** in the left sidebar

3. **Click "New Token"** or "Generate Token"

4. **Choose "Read-Only Token"** (for production use)

5. **Copy the token** (you won't see it again!)

6. **Give it to your developer** - They need to add it to:
   - The `.env.local` file for local development
   - Vercel environment variables for production

---

## 📝 What You Can Edit

Once your developer adds the token and builds the site, you can edit:

### Homepage
- **Hero Section**: Main heading, subheading, call-to-action buttons
- **Expertise Badges**: The 8 service types (Auto Accidents, Personal Injury, etc.)
- **Statistics**: Years in business, cases won, satisfaction rate
- **Practice Areas**: All 10 practice areas with descriptions and colors
- **Testimonials**: Client reviews and ratings
- **Contact Form**: Form heading and description

### Blog Posts
- Create new blog posts
- Edit existing posts
- Add images, format text with Markdown
- Categorize (Personal Injury, Legal Updates, Case Studies)

### Site Settings
- Business contact information (phone, email, address)
- Social media links (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn)
- Brand colors
