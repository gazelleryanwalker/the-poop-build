   ```
   https://thecostellolawgroup.com/admin
   ```

3. **Log in** with your GitHub account.

4. **You are now in VISUAL EDITING MODE!**
   - You will see a **TinaCMS sidebar** on the left.
   - **Click on any text or image** on the page to edit it directly.
   - The changes will appear **in real-time**.

5. **Click "Save"** in the sidebar to commit your changes.
