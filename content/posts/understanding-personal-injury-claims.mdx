# Understanding Personal Injury Claims in Florida

If you've been injured due to someone else's negligence, you may be entitled to compensation. Personal injury claims in Florida can be complex, but understanding the process is the first step toward getting the justice you deserve.

## What is a Personal Injury Claim?

A personal injury claim is a legal dispute that arises when one person suffers harm from an accident or injury, and someone else might be legally responsible for that harm. These claims can arise from:

- **Auto accidents** - Car, truck, motorcycle, or pedestrian accidents
- **Slip and fall incidents** - Premises liability cases
- **Medical malpractice** - Healthcare provider negligence
- **Product liability** - Defective products causing injury
- **Wrongful death** - Fatal accidents caused by negligence

## The Claims Process in Florida

### 1. Seek Medical Attention

Your health is the top priority. Seek immediate medical attention and keep detailed records of all treatments, diagnoses, and expenses.

### 2. Document Everything

Collect evidence including:
- Photos of the accident scene and injuries
- Witness contact information
- Police reports
- Medical records and bills
- Lost wage documentation

### 3. Contact an Experienced Attorney

The Costello Law Group offers free consultations to evaluate your case. We work on a contingency basis, meaning you don't pay unless we win your case.

### 4. Investigation and Negotiation

We'll thoroughly investigate your claim, gather evidence, and negotiate with insurance companies on your behalf to secure maximum compensation.

### 5. Litigation if Necessary

If a fair settlement cannot be reached, we're prepared to take your case to trial and fight for your rights in court.

## Types of Compensation Available

Personal injury victims in Florida may be entitled to:

- **Medical expenses** - Past and future medical bills
- **Lost wages** - Income lost due to injury
- **Pain and suffering** - Physical and emotional distress
- **Property damage** - Vehicle or property repair costs
- **Loss of earning capacity** - Reduced ability to work
- **Punitive damages** - In cases of gross negligence

## Florida's Statute of Limitations

In Florida, you generally have **four years** from the date of the accident to file a personal injury lawsuit. However, there are exceptions, so it's crucial to consult with an attorney as soon as possible.
