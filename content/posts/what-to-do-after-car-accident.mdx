Being involved in a car accident can be a traumatic and overwhelming experience. In the immediate aftermath, it's crucial to take the right steps to protect your health, your legal rights, and your ability to recover fair compensation for your injuries and damages.

## Immediate Steps at the Accident Scene

The moments following a car accident are critical. Your actions during this time can significantly impact your ability to file a successful insurance claim or personal injury lawsuit.

### 1. Check for Injuries and Call 911

Your first priority should always be safety and health. Check yourself and your passengers for injuries, and call 911 immediately if anyone is hurt. Even if injuries seem minor, it's important to have medical professionals evaluate everyone involved. Some injuries, such as whiplash or internal trauma, may not be immediately apparent.

### 2. Move to a Safe Location

If possible and if your vehicle is drivable, move it to the side of the road or a safe location away from traffic. Turn on your hazard lights to alert other drivers. However, if anyone is seriously injured or if moving the vehicles could cause further damage, leave them in place and wait for emergency responders.

### 3. Call the Police

In Florida, you are required to report any accident that results in injury, death, or property damage exceeding $500. Even if the accident seems minor, having an official police report can be invaluable when filing an insurance claim. The police report will document the scene, gather witness statements, and may include the officer's assessment of fault.

## Gathering Evidence at the Scene

While waiting for the police to arrive, gather as much evidence as possible. This documentation will be crucial for your insurance claim and any potential legal action.

### Exchange Information

Collect the following information from all drivers involved in the accident:

- Full name and contact information
- Driver's license number
- License plate number
- Insurance company and policy number
- Vehicle make, model, and year

### Document the Scene

Use your smartphone to take photographs and videos of:

- All vehicles involved, from multiple angles
- Damage to your vehicle and other vehicles
- The accident scene, including road conditions, traffic signs, and skid marks
- Any visible injuries
- The location and position of the vehicles

### Gather Witness Information

If there are any witnesses to the accident, ask for their names and contact information. Witness testimony can be crucial in establishing fault, especially if the other driver disputes your version of events.

## Seek Medical Attention

Even if you feel fine, it's essential to see a doctor as soon as possible after the accident. Some injuries, such as concussions, soft tissue damage, or internal bleeding, may not show symptoms immediately. A medical examination creates a record of your injuries and establishes a link between the accident and your medical condition.

Under Florida's Personal Injury Protection (PIP) law, you must seek medical treatment within 14 days of the accident to be eligible for PIP benefits.

## Notify Your Insurance Company

Contact your insurance company to report the accident as soon as possible. Provide them with the basic facts of the accident, but avoid making detailed statements or admitting fault until you've consulted with an attorney. Remember that insurance companies are businesses focused on minimizing payouts.

## Consult with a Car Accident Attorney

Before accepting any settlement offer from an insurance company, consult with an experienced car accident attorney. Insurance companies often offer quick settlements that are far below the true value of your claim. An attorney can:

- Evaluate the full extent of your damages
- Negotiate with insurance companies on your behalf
- Gather additional evidence to support your claim
- Represent you in court if necessary

At The Costello Law Group, we offer free consultations for car accident victims. We work on a contingency fee basis, which means you don't pay unless we win your case.

## What NOT to Do After a Car Accident

Avoid these common mistakes that could jeopardize your claim:

- **Don't admit fault**: Even if you think you may have contributed to the accident, don't apologize or admit fault at the scene. Let the insurance companies and legal professionals determine liability.
- **Don't give recorded statements**: Insurance adjusters may ask for recorded statements. Politely decline until you've spoken with an attorney.
- **Don't post on social media**: Insurance companies often monitor social media accounts for evidence that could undermine your claim.
- **Don't delay medical treatment**: Waiting too long to see a doctor can give insurance companies grounds to argue that your injuries weren't serious or weren't caused by the accident.
- **Don't accept the first settlement offer**: Initial offers are often lowball amounts designed to close the claim quickly.
